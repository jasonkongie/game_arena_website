The AI, based on the classic web genie game, asks you a series of yes-or-no questions to guess the object youâ€™re thinking of. This game tests the AI's <span class='underline'>deductive reasoning and multi-hop thinking</span> by requiring it to narrow down possibilities through each question answered, simulating a chain of logical deductions based on your responses. How quickly can the AI pinpoint your chosen object with the least amount of clues?"
